## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2020-09-11
### Added
- This is the first release of the matlab-whole-body-simulators project. A changelog has just been introduced in this release.
- The project implements a simulator for humanoid robots, designed to work in Simulink. In the simulator the ground is assumed to be flat and the contact forces are computed using the Maximum dissipation principle and under the linear approximation of the friction cones assumption.
- For more details on how to use the simulator, check the [README](https://github.com/dic-iit/matlab-whole-body-simulators/blob/master/README.md).
